- ✅ Dashboard → Recent Games
- ✅ Look for game entry with video file path
- ✅ Navigate to file path and verify video exists

**2. Refresh Gallery**:
- ✅ Click "Refresh" button in gallery view
- ✅ Or restart LoLShorts

**3. Check Event Detection**:
- ✅ Clips are created based on detected events (kills, objectives)
- ✅ If game had no significant events, no clips created
- ✅ Expected: 3-10 clips per game (varies by performance)

**4. Database Sync**:
- ✅ Wait 30-60 seconds after game ends
- ✅ Background processing may still be running
- ✅ Check progress indicator

---

## Auto-Edit Issues

### "No clips found for the selected games"

**Error Message**:
```
No clips found for the selected games

Make sure you have:
- Recorded some games
- Interesting events occurred (kills, objectives, etc.)
- Clips were successfully saved
```

**Solutions**:

**1. Verify Games Have Clips**:
- ✅ Go to Gallery view
- ✅ Check selected games have associated clips
- ✅ If no clips, record more games first

**2. Check Event Detection Threshold**:
- ✅ Settings → Auto-Edit → Event Priority Threshold

Found: 25s of clips
Required: 60s

Try:
- Selecting more games

- ✅ OR reduce target duration to 30s or 45s
- ✅ OR lower priority threshold in settings

**Long-Term Fix**:
- ✅ Record more games with higher performance
- ✅ Focus on games with pentakills, baron steals, multi-kills
- ✅ Average game needs 3-5 clips minimum

---

### "Video generation failed: Failed to merge video clips"

**Cause**: Clip files have incompatible formats or are corrupted.

**Solutions**:

**1. Check Clip File Integrity**:
- ✅ Navigate to clips folder
- ✅ Try playing clips in VLC Media Player
- ✅ If clips won't play, they're corrupted (re-record)

**2. Clear Temp Files**:
```
1. Close LoLShorts
2. Navigate to: C:\Users\[You]\AppData\Local\LoLShorts\temp\
3. Delete all files in temp folder
4. Restart LoLShorts and retry
```

- ✅ Recommended: 32-48px for titles

**3. Check Output Resolution**:
- ✅ Videos are rendered at 1080x1920
- ✅ Canvas scales from 360x640 preview
- ✅ This is expected, not a bug

**4. Use TrueType Fonts (.ttf)**:
- ✅ OTF fonts may not render correctly
- ✅ Convert to TTF if needed

---

### "Logo/image looks stretched or distorted"

**Cause**: Image aspect ratio doesn't match element size.

**Solution**:

**1. Maintain Aspect Ratio**:
- ✅ If logo is 500x500 (1:1), use 60x60 canvas size
- ✅ If logo is 1000x500 (2:1), use 120x60 canvas size

**2. Pre-Resize Images**:
- ✅ Use Photoshop/GIMP to resize to exact dimensions
- ✅ Recommended: 300x300 for logos (1:1 ratio)
- ✅ Export as PNG with transparency

**3. Use Correct Format**:
- ✅ PNG for logos (supports transparency)
- ✅ JPG for photos (no transparency)
- ✅ Avoid BMP, TIFF, or other formats

---

## Audio Issues

### "Background music is too loud / too quiet"

**Solution**: Adjust audio mixer levels

**Quick Fix**:
```
1. Go to Auto-Edit → Audio tab
2. Try different presets:
   - Music too loud? → Game Focus (85% / 15%)
   - Music too quiet? → Cinematic (60% / 40%)
3. Generate test video to verify
```

**Manual Adjustment**:
```
1. Click "Custom" preset
2. Adjust sliders:
   - Game Audio: 60-90%
